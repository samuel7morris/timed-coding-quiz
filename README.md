# timed-coding-quiz
This coding quiz was designed to base your score on the time left on the clock when you have completed all the questions.  It then asks you for your initials and adds it to a list of high scores. If you want to view the high scores, you click the high scores button and are then taken to a page that displays all previous scores.
